# pokemon_checker
This is a simply Django application which takes two inputs of pokemon names and checks their stats against each other.

This application uses PokeAPI to get information.

The main application launches on: http://127.0.0.1:8000/pokecheck/check/

It takes two inputs of different pokemon.

It then returns the pokemon that has an inherent advantage along with a link to the winning pokemons PokeDex page.
